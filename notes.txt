TODO:
- expand two nodes
- write progressive widening function
- write single objective MCTS
	- BUG: in simulation(), returned episode weird --> nodes do not alternate between chance and decision nodes --> Fixed
	- BUG: utility values not set --> Fixed
	- BUG: in expansion phase, attempt to cast chance node into decision node --> problem most likely related to tdrs13 (not observable) --> Fixed (expansion only on decision node)
	- BUG: propergated environment updated in a weird way. Objects that are not selected for sensor tasking are propagated to random epochs and orbit information is also updated --> fixed
	- BUG: final utility of root node is negative --> fixed (expanded too far beyond end campaign)
	- BUG: MCTS selects same nodes sequentially even though object's uncertainty should have shrinked down --> Adjust KF parameters
	- BUG: solar phase condition not met after 2024-07-12T12:25:43.000Z so that there is no target that can be selected --> fixed (don't expand node if target is not observable)
	- BUG: algorithm stuck on object 22314 --> stuck because it is the only object that is observable --> no bug!
	- BUG: running 10 min of search tasks reveals detection of object 26495 but when extending to 20min, that object does not get detected anymore --> fixed
	- BUG: Weight update not correct when combining tracking and searching objective --> fixed (needed to multiply initial time resources by initial weights)

TODO: 
	- add references to paper --> finished
	- implement sensor in tracking objective --> finished
	- call mcts multiple times and decide on which which branch to execute
	- roll out after search task was expanded
