TODO:
- expand two nodes
- write progressive widening function
- write single objective MCTS
	- BUG: in simulation(), returned episode weird --> nodes do not alternate between chance and decision nodes --> Fixed
	- BUG: utility values not set --> Fixed
	- BUG: in expansion phase, attempt to cast chance node into decision node --> problem most likely related to tdrs13 (not observable) --> Fixed (expansion only on decision node)
	- BUG: propergated environment updated in a weird way. Objects that are not selected for sensor tasking are propagated to random epochs and orbit information is also updated --> fixed
	- BUG: final utility of root node is negative --> fixed (ecpanded to far beyond end campaign)
